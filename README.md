ultratap
========

Ultratap is a simple-yet-challenging 2D game requiring skill and fast reaction times. 
Ultratap is quite fast and surprisingly addictive, ideal for both short bursts of fun as well as longer play sessions.

## Info
This game has been created during a windows phone coding session at Fachhochschule Erfurt in 2012.
